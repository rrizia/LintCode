Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. 
Using trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). 
If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, 
where M is maximum string length and N is number of keys in tree. Using trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. 
However the penalty is on trie storage requirements.
